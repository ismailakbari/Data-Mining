# Data-Mining
I have written some MATLAB codes that can become handy for clustering.
<br>
Files and their purpose:<br>
1.Davies_Bouldin.m : Davies Bouldin index <br>
2. Dunn.m : Dunn index<br>
3. stddev.m: standard deviation<br>
4. CleanData.m: Clean data in excel files (removing rows with missing values)<br>
5. ReadData.m: read data from an excel file and put it in a matrix<br>
